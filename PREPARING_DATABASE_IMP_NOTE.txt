So the create_mavenfuzzyfactory.sql file that you are going to be running in the next lecture is pretty big.
Some students have experienced issues running this file due to their default max_allowed_packet setting. This basically just limits the size of a file that Workbench will run for you.

The good news is, you can update your max_allowed_packet setting by running the following command in MySQL Workbench: 

SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet = 1073741824;

Running this command will allow Workbench to accept a larger file (of size 1073741824 in this case).



In order to run this command...

1. Open Workbench and click into the Connection you set up previously

2. Type the command into the editor (as pictured below)

3. Click on the Lightning Bolt to run the query (the one without the cursor and without the magnifying glass is fine)
