Now it is working fine and the script was run successfully.

What I did was deleting MySQL completely from my laptop and installed again and chose version 8.0.16  (the same version I noticed in the course video) and it worked fine after that.

I followed these steps to uninstall my version before installing the new one

Go to Control Panel >Programs and Features > Select MySQL > Click on Uninstall.

Click on Start, type in Show hidden files and folders.

Select the View tab and select Show hidden files and folders.

Now explore the following locations and delete following folders.

C:\Program Files\MySQL

C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL

C:\ProgramData\MySQL

And if exists, delete the folder from the location.

C:\Users\[User-Name]\AppData\Roaming\MySQL

Restart your device and check the status.
